Global Exception Handling using @ControllerAdvice
Add a class with annotation @ControllerAdvice and @RestController. This will make the class return a Rest Response.


@ControllerAdvice tells your spring application that this class will do the exception handling for your application. 
@RestController will make it a controller and let this class render the response.
Use @ExceptionHandler annotation to define the class of Exception it will catch. (A Base class will catch all the Inherited and extended classes) 
You can set the response status for exception using @ResponseStatus annotation.
